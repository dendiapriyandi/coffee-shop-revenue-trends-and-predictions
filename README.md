# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis & Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project explores and predicts coffee shop sales using data analysis and machine learning. It consists of two main parts:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding sales trends, customer behavior, and key insights.
2. **Predictive Modeling:** Building a model to forecast future sales based on historical data.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `EDA of Coffee Shop Sales.ipynb` â†’ Exploratory Data Analysis
- `Model of Coffee Shop Sales.ipynb` â†’ Machine Learning Model

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis
In the EDA notebook, we analyze sales data to uncover:
- Seasonal trends ðŸ“…
- Best-selling products â˜•
- Customer purchasing patterns ðŸ›’
- Revenue distribution ðŸ’°

## ðŸ¤– Sales Prediction Model
The model uses machine learning to predict future sales based on historical data. Techniques include:
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Model selection (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Performance evaluation using metrics like RMSE & RÂ²

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/coffee-shop-sales.git
   ```
2. Open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run the EDA notebook to explore insights.
4. Execute the modeling notebook to train and test the predictive model.

## ðŸ›  Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

Install dependencies using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸ“Œ Key Insights
- **Peak Sales Periods:** Identify high-traffic times for better inventory planning.
- **Customer Preferences:** Understand which products drive revenue.
- **Sales Forecasting:** Help the business optimize stock and pricing strategies.
